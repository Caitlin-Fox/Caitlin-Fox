👋 Hi, I’m @Caitlin-Fox! I'm a statistics graduate currently working as an analyst, delivering an array of risk modelling projects and supporting decision making through the application of data science techniques. 

I’m interested in all things data, with a particular passion for graphically presenting data in an accessible and digestible way. I have proficiently coded in R for several years now and am looking to expand my knowledge of the R tidyverse through some freelance projects.
