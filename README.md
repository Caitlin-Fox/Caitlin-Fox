ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Caitlin-Fox! I'm currently working as an analyst, delivering an array of risk modelling projects and supporting decision making 
through the application of data science techniques. 

Iâ€™m interested in all things data science and am looking to expand my knowledge of the R tidyverse through some freelance projects. 
I have proficiently coded in R for several years now and this remains to be the primary language I use.
